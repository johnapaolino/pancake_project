## Candidate Project
Welcome to Yieldbot! Here is a working example project we'd like to see you
work with to show some of your work changing around this codebase.

[![js-semistandard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-semistandard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/solenoid/pancake_project)

You'll find a set of problems in the [TODO](TODO.md) that likely has one or more
that will let you show what you can do. Please work the problems you figured
out were best for you and feel free to reach out if it isn't clear what next
steps are needed on your part.

Don't forget to enjoy and hopefully learn something along the way.

If you have any questions please feel free to email me at esolen@yieldbot.com

### Requirements
node and npm minimally, but figure out precisely how best to say this.

### Setup
```
npm install       # get dev and app dependencies
npm run build-dev # first time setup for local development
npm start         # run webpack dev server and thin backend server
```

### JavaScript Getting started
Until I have time to write a better guide this is one of the best I've read.

Soon I hope to have a version written that will be mostly the same, but
different on some specific advice and library decisions.

### ES6 Cheatsheet
In case the newer syntax is throwing you for a loop.

#### Imports / Exports specifically
Because it can be a little odd until understood.
